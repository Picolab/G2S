Project goal: create a Sovrin agent using picos

Write rulesets which, when installed in a pico, make that pico behave as
a Sovrin agent. Call any such pico "a Pico Agent".

1. a Pico Agent provides a UI for its (human) owner
2. a Pico Agent interoperates with other Sovrin Agents
 - can provide an invitation to connect
 - can accept another agent's invitation to connect
 - can request a connection using another's invitation
 - can respond to another's connection request
 - can send/receive basic messages
 - can send/receive trust pings
3. a Pico Agent maintains a list of connections to other agents
 - its own secret key for each connection
 - the public key of the other end of each connection
4. a Pico Agent maintains owner credentials for each connection
 - can ask for a credential through a connection
 - can verify a credential received from another agent
5. a Pico Agent can provide a credential-based proof to another agent
